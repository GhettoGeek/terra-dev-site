Terra-dev-site then adds an entry, the html-webpack-plugin and an additional resolve path for custom site configuration. Unlike terra-toolkit, this webpack config is ready to use without needing any wrapping.\\n\\nThe default webpack config has been moved from `src/config/webpack.config` to `config/webpack/webpack.config`;\\nMuch like terra-toolkit the dev and prod webpack configs have been merged into one. See that guide for more info.\\n\\n## WebdriverIO\\nTerra Dev Site provides a default webdriver IO config. This config adds in some additional opinions specific to terra-dev-site, and unlike terra-toolkit, is ready out of the box.\\n\\nThe webdriver config pulls in the default webpack config, the root selector for tests when terra dev site is used as a driver and a before hook to refresh the page after each test.\\n\\n## Terra-Dev-Site Config\\nWe're preparing to generate more code on launch of terra-dev-site instead of generating it client side. For the first step we're requiring that the `site.config.js` file be placed inside the `dev-site-config` folder at the project root for better organization as well as a location to place generated items.\\n\\nThe placeholder image and logo image are now defaulted to the Terra image.\\n\""],"sourceRoot":""}
