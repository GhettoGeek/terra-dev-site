# v6.0.0 Upgrade Guide

This document will provide information on upgrading from Terra Toolkit `5.0.0` to `6.0.0`.

## site.config

A few sections have been removed from site.config.

* Theme import - The need for this option has been removed with the aggregate-themes project.

* Extension config - The new navigation has a tighter definition of extensions and the github link no longer makes sense as an extension.

## navigation.config

* Hide - The option to hide a navigation tab has been removed. This option was always a little weird. We wanted to hide the test tab for terra-ui and have access to it for sites with tests. It has caused discoverability issues and it's best if we just show the tab if available.

## Browser Router

Previously terra-dev-site used a hash router `/#/` to display it's pages. This interferes with anchor tags which also use the hash to denote where to go on the page. To resolve this terra-dev-site has switched to a browser router. Current links using the hash router will still resolve, slash routes with the hash will be redirected to the equivalent non hash route.

## Dynamic Imports
The code generated by terra dev site has always required transpilation, but with the addition of code splitting, the @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import babel plugin is now required.

```
npm install --save-dev @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import
```
